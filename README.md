# Yay placeholder CUPY or not! from feeding in a paste of research on the leading edge; definately a placeholder I think; it took like 20 seconds at most.

We optimize the leading-edge angle by combining a radar cross section (RCS) value
with a performance metric derived from the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.

[DEBUG] Angle=60, RCS=0.09116155923255148, Performance=3811.635160626248, Score=38.20751316549503
[DEBUG] optimize_leading_edge completed. Best angle=0, Best score=38.12633494792716
[CAD_DEBUG] Upgrade result: {'optimal_angle': 0, 'combined_score': 38.12633494792716, 'stealth_improvement': 0.00025}

This is just a little demo of calculating radar cross section of the leading edge, something I guarantee you Tulsi Gabbard has classified, enough; how would one optimizee on mr rocket to plane equaiton, by much if simple starter?

# you might think that doing this helps shoot it down more, and it does not; all it does is attempt to find a computationally aided algorithm to find a desired stealth solution, then it provides the numbers needed to build such a solution, however there are minor cognition benefits..
